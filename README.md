# ClimbingLog

This Climbing Log App should give users the ability to log how long they spent climbing, what routes they climbed (or just their favorite), and where they are climbing. In order to view friends climbing logs, users should also be able to sign in using a Facebook or a Google account, or they can look at who's climbed at their home wall. There is a big focus on the climbing community and being able to connect with others and see how they have climbed as well. For our local audience, think the Calvin climbing wall. For our global audience, think the whole climbing community from Red River to Yosemite.
Pros: 
There is a huge base of users at Calvin who would use it.
Climbing is a rapidly growing hobby
Most Climbing Apps are focused on data compilation and getting routes, rather than the communion of climbers
Most fitness apps are personal trainers, with no relation to the climbing wall.
The average difficulty climbed is a good method of engaging members to log what they climb, and hopefully climb and/or log harder climbs.
Cons:
We would need to store some basic info about each user/location on a server.
People might not want to log every route they climbed
I recommend asking the user what their favorite route was, and then optionally having them add additional routes. This encourages them to log at least one route per climb
How often will people log their climb?
needs to be easy and quick to do, without too much thought on the user's part. Our goal is to log at least one route per climb
Goals:
Ability to log climbs
Ability to add routes (can mark as warm-up, won't count towards average)
Have a page for each Climbing Wall that contains
Recently Climbed routes
Who all climbs at this wall
Average difficulty climbed
Have a profile page for each person that contains
Recently Climbed routes
Where they have climbed/Favorite Places
Where they'd like to climb
What equipment they have
Average difficulty climbed
Google/Facebook account log-in
Stretch Goals:
Fitbit support
Export user log to Microsoft Excel
Existing Apps:
MyClimb - Probably the most similar to ours
Very aesthetic design, ability to view friends/community's climbs
Geared more towards outdoor climbs
Lots of bugs, one star reviews
Mountain Project - more focused towards places than community/logging fitness
Basically they are trying to log every route everywhere and make a database of places
Climbing Trainer Timer - Meant to be for home workouts/workouts not for daily climbing
More of a personal fitness app than a climbing
Simple Climbing Log - very barebones, only meant for personal viewing
I like the export log to excel function
Conclusion:
This would be a very fun app to make. There is a huge community at Calvin specifically that would love to use this. I am personally very passionate about climbing and I would like to see this come to fruition. Of the many climbing apps, ours will be very unique. There is only one in particular that also includes friend/community tracking. Other climbing apps are geared towards either route compilation or personal training. Ours both, but with a focus on community tracking and sharing routes with your friends. I believe there is a big audience of climbers that has not yet been reached, and if we do this right, starting with the Calvin Climbing Wall, we could make a huge splash in the community of climbers.
