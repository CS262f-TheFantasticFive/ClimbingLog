# Vision Statement
There is a big focus on the climbing community and being able to connect with others and see how they have climbed. For our local audience, think the Calvin climbing wall. For our global audience, think the whole climbing community from Red River to Yosemite. Our Climbing Log App should give users the ability to log how long they have spent climbing, which routes they have climbed (or just their favorite), and where they are currently climbing. It should also give them the ability to see their friends' climbing logs. We have a lot of goals for this project, such as allowing users to: log their climbs, add routes, have a profile that contains recently climbed routes and favorite ones, and more. 

Other apps that are similar to ours include MyClimb, which is probably the most similar to ours. Mountain Project, which is more focused towards places than community or logging fitness. Climbing Trainer Timer, which is meant to be for home workouts or workouts not for daily climbing. Simple Climbing Log which is very basic and barebones, only meant for personal viewing. 

There is a huge community at Calvin, full of people who are personally very passionate about climbing and would like to see this come to fruition. Of the many climbing apps, ours will be unique. There is only one in particular that also includes friend and community tracking. Other climbing apps are geared towards either route compilation or personal training. Ours will do both, but with a focus on community tracking and sharing routes with your friends. We believe that there is a big audience of climbers that has not yet been reached, and if we do this right, we could make a huge splash in the community of climbers.
