# Vision Statement
In the climbing community, there is a large focus on being able to connect with others and see how they have climbed. This desire ranges from the climbers at the local Calvin wall to the global climbing community from Red River to Yosemite. Our Climbing Log App will give users the ability to log when they have climbed, which routes they took (or just their favorite), and where they are currently climbing. It will also give them the ability to see their friends' climbing logs.

There are a few existing apps that are similar to ours, MyClimb being the most similar. Mountain Project is more focused on climbing locations than community or logging fitness. Climbing Trainer Timer is meant to be for home workouts or workouts that are not for daily climbing. Simple Climbing Log is very bare-bones and only meant for personal viewing. These climbing apps are, in general, meant to be used for compiling routes or personal training. Our app will differ from these apps by allowing the user to network with friends and other members of the climbing community, in addition to recording stats and routes. Admittedly, MyClimb allows this sort of networking as well, but its interface is frustrating - we can do better.

The Calvin climbing community is passionate about climbing and would live to see an app that gives them the tools to see how far they have come as climbers, as well as meet others who are just as passionate about climbing as they are.
